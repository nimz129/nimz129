### Hi there 👋
Hey, nice to meet you and this is crazy
but here's my account, so follow me, maybe?

- 🔭 I’m currently a third year undergraduate student in Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence) course. 
- 🌱 Interested in Fuzzy Logic, Evolutionary computing, NLP and graphic designing.
      I do have interest in deep learning and trying to learn deeply on this neural network field. 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm clever and blur at the same time ;)
- 🪄 Currently in last semester and working on final year project which the title is: Malaysia Covid-19 Vaccination Intelligent Dashboard. Which including the prediction of side effect of vaccine using deep learning, sentiment analysis through social media about vaccine and some important insights of vaccine in dashboard using Power BI.
