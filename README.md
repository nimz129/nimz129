Hey, nice to meet you and this is crazy
but here's my account, so follow me, maybe?

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently a third year undergraduate student in Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence) course. 
- ğŸŒ± Interested in Fuzzy Logic, Evolutionary computing, NLP and graphic designing.
      I do have interest in deep learning and trying to learn deeply on this neural network field.
